Their technical skills and role experience are in frontend development and backend development, whereas the job requires UI/UX design skills (Figma, User Research, Prototyping). Although they have experience in React and Node.js, it does not translate to UI/UX design skills. They have a strong educational background, but it does not align with the job requirements. Their experience in competitive programming and hackathons is impressive, but it also does not directly relate to the job at hand. Their preferences for 'workMode' and 'companyPreference' are not aligned with the job, and their salary requirement is also not met by the job offer."
