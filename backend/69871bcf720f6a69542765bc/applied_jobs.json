            "clarification": "## JOB MISSION & DOMAIN\nGoldman Sachs requires a Backend Engineer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and Data Structures to develop high-throughput financial systems in Hyderabad. The role demands a strong algorithmic thinking background, with C++ being a plus, but the candidate will need to adapt to the Java ecosystem and work onsite. Daily tasks involve designing, implementing, and maintaining high-performance systems for financial transactions.\n\n## COMPATIBILITY INDEX:\n38% | Medium\n\n## TECHNICAL DELTA\n\n| Requirement | Candidate Status | Gap Severity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Java | Not mentioned | High |\n| Spring Boot | Not mentioned | High |\n| Microservices | Not mentioned | High |\n| Data Structures | Not mentioned | Medium |\n| C++ for strong algorithmic thinking | Mentioned in profile | Low |\n\n## STRATEGIC MISMATCHES\n\n* The candidate has a minimum salary expectation of 80,000, which is significantly lower than the offered salary of 2,200,000.\n* The candidate does not possess the required skills for the Backend Engineer position, including Spring Boot and Microservices.\n* The candidate's notice period is immediately, which is a perfect match for the job's immediate start date.\n* The candidate's visa status is not sponsored, and they do not have a valid visa for the job location.\n\n## SYSTEM ADVISORY\nBased on the technical delta and strategic mismatches, this application is not viable for the Backend Engineer position at Goldman Sachs. The candidate lacks the required skills, and their minimum salary expectation is significantly lower than the offered salary. Additionally, the candidate's visa status and notice period do not align with the job requirements. If the user chooses to proceed, they must accept the following conditions:\n\n* The candidate will require significant training and development to acquire the required skills.\n* The candidate's salary will need to be adjusted to meet the offered salary of 2,200,000.\n* The candidate's visa status will need to be resolved, and they will require sponsorship for a valid visa.\n* The candidate's notice period will need to be extended to accommodate the job's requirements.\n\nThe user must carefully weigh these conditions and assess the candidate's potential for growth and adaptation before making a decision."
