His experience in frontend and backend development, as well as data science, is not applicable to the job. His achievements, such as securing 4th rank at HaXplore - CodeFest'25, are also unrelated to the position. His work mode preference is not applicable as the job is onsite only. His minimum salary requirement is $15000, which is significantly lower than the job offer of $1100000. The company preference is not fully met as the candidate prefers Google and Facebook, but the job is at Birlasoft."
