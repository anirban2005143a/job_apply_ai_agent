        "match_reason": "The candidate has a good educational background from IIT ISM. They have relevant skills and experience in software development but require a longer notice period and prefer remote work. While the job location is available in their city preference, the job is onsite, and the salary is above their minimum preference. However, the job requires skills in JavaScript, Selenium, and Automation Testing, which are partially aligned with their skills.",
        "clarification": "## JOB MISSION & DOMAIN\nThe QA Automation Engineer at Wipro will develop and maintain automated test suites for web applications, primarily working on-site in Bangalore, India. The role requires expertise in JavaScript, Selenium, and Automation Testing, with a need for collaboration and problem-solving skills to ensure the quality of web applications.\n\n### COMPATIBILITY INDEX: 45% | High\nThere are significant gaps in the required skills and experience for the QA Automation Engineer position at Wipro. Although the candidate has relevant skills and experience in software development, they lack expertise in JavaScript, Selenium, and Automation Testing.\n\n### TECHNICAL DELTA\n\n| Requirement | Candidate Status | Gap Severity |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| JavaScript | Not mentioned | High Severity |\n| Selenium | Not mentioned | High Severity |\n| Automation Testing | Not mentioned | High Severity |\n| On-site work | Not mentioned | Medium Severity (prefers remote work) |\n| Notice period | Not mentioned | Medium Severity (requests immediately) |\n| Required skills | 8 out of 15 mentioned skills | Medium Severity (only partially aligned) |\n\n### STRATEGIC MISMATCHES\n\n- Salary mismatch: The candidate's minimum salary preference (15,000 INR) is lower than the offered salary (1,000,000 INR).\n- Visa sponsorship mismatch: The job does not offer visa sponsorship, but the candidate does not have a valid visa.\n- Location mismatch: The job is onsite in Bangalore, which is not the candidate's preferred location.\n\n### SYSTEM ADVISORY\nThe candidate's application has a 45% compatibility index, indicating a high risk of failure. The significant gaps in required skills and experience, along with the salary and visa sponsorship mismatches, make it challenging for the candidate to succeed in the QA Automation Engineer position at Wipro. The candidate would need to accept the onsite work arrangement, which goes against their preference for remote work, and demonstrate a willingness to learn and adapt to the required skills quickly."
